This is a collection of my personal scripts, used in my Windows machines.

The original repository is actually a [Mercurial][] one, currently mirrored in Github via [hg-git][].

I've published these for my own convenience and for showcasing my work to anyone interested.

Prerequisites:

* Windows 7 or higher
* PowerShell 5.1
* Python 3.7 or higher
* Several Python modules, including `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `pillow`, etc. Check the import statements in each Python script for more details.
